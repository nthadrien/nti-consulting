## What is an Inventory?

An inventory is like making a detailed list of everything a company owns and evaluating their current value. It's commonly about keeping track of stocks and assets.
There are two main ways to do inventory: one is to constantly update records as items come and go (perpetual inventory), and the other is to physically count everything at least once a year (physical inventory).

## Why is an Inventory Important?

Doing an inventory each year helps a company check and confirm the value of its belongings and debts. It's essential for creating accurate financial reports at the end of the year based on both the records and the physical count.
