##  Manual of Administrative, Financial, and Accounting Procedures?

The manual of administrative, financial, and accounting procedures is a necessary document for establishing a coherent and transparent system within a company's organization. In this sense, it serves as a reference for all stakeholders and a tool for ongoing internal control. However, it is important to emphasize that the procedures manual is not a cure-all for all of the organization's problems. However, when used with intelligent rigor, it enables the company to become operational. The procedures manual should not be a static tool. It should evolve with the organization and follow its dynamics. Therefore, after a certain period, it needs to be updated.
